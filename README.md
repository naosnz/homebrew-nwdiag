# nwdiag Homebrew Formula

[nwdiag](https://github.com/blockdiag/nwdiag) is part of the
[blockdiag](https://github.com/blockdiag) project.  It provides
diagram tools for drawing network specific diagrams, such as rack
diagrams.

For more information on using nwdiag see
[the nwdiag documentation](http://blockdiag.com/en/nwdiag/).

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install naosnz/nwdiag/nwdiag`

Or `brew tap naosnz/nwdiag` and then `brew install nwdiag`.

For simplicity of install, this `nwdiag` Formula bundles the install
of the `blockdiag` dependency into the same Python virtual environemnt,
rather than installing `blockdiag` separately.
